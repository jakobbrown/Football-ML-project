The type of data contained in the data frames are consistent for each league, however there are some missing seasons - hence the lack of uniformity in the number of rows - which may need to be addressed when feature engineering based on ranking or team performance from the previous season.

    "To go alongside the in-game statistics of the teams collected, another big factor in team success is the amount of financial input the club receives to bring in players that will assist their performance. A team can perform poorly one season, and then can demonstrate a drastic performance improvement due a revivial of personnel from financial backing of the owners. Conversely, a team that does not receive much financial support would be expected to gradually decline in performance as other teams continue to develop, especially at the extremely high and competitive levels that these leagues are. These are the biggest, and therefore most televised football leagues in the world, and thus money circulating through these leagues play a very important role."

Some columns like losing at half time at home and leading at half time are telling us slightly different things, but not different enough to justify their collinearity. The rest many of which are highly correlated, will be kept for the time being, and will be reduced in the modelling stage through applying a threshold to the lassoCV feature importance coefficients. This provides some empirical confidence and reasoning to the selection of features, which is preferred to attempting to reduce the features intuitively."

    "Unlike many other studies, which only use data from one nation or league as input for their machine learning models, this data set contains data from the 4 biggest football leagues in Europe. It should be treated with caution and explored, as different styles of play can perhaps result in different statistics (for example, England is known for being a more aggressive, fast-paced league, so high average possession may not be as big an indicator of team success than in other leagues). It should be checked whether these nuances in style could have an impact when training the model and predicting rankings from a specific league."

    "The linear regression from sklearn appears capable of predicting within 10 points of the actual following season points total, and when averaged across folds, the model predicts within 8.26 points of the actual value, which is a fairly good result. The scaled version performs minutely worse than the unscaled version. With the suspected high levels of multicollinearity, it may be worth comparing the linear regression model with lasso and ridge regression models, which are more suited to inter-correlated independent variables, and therefore may be be able to a) yield a stronger validation result, and b) indicate what features can be derived from others and thus reduce the complexity of the feature set."

A notable decrease in performance can also be seen for all models between the training set and the test set, typically around 1 point in MAE. This could be attributed to a slight case of overfitting. It could also be the case that there is some selection bias present, given the purposeful extraction of the test set based on the availability of a complete set of teams for a given league in a given season. this resulted in the test set consisting of only two different years and two different league's data. This however, should not have resulted in any non-representative test set, as differences between leagues were checked earlier on in the research. Nor should when data was taken from have any relationship to the data itself, at least not in the small 12 year window from which this data set is sampled."

This means that the linear regression model selected is likely to underpredict high points tallies, and over-predict low ones, and the results are now dubious. This could be down to many extraneous factors in football producing surprising results, especially in the case of the outlier that can be seen in the left-hand plot of the residuals against the target variable."

    "Once examined, it can be seen how the model would predict such a low points tally following on from the seasons Chelsea and Monaco had. It was unable to tell what a high profile clubs they are and their usual performance. Although it was a conscious choice to use just current season points instead of a rolling average of points tallies in previous seasons, given the ebb and flow of team's quality which can and have changed a lot over the time period input in to the model, this feature would have most likely prevented this kind of residual slipping through. Future work should look to compare the use of a rolling average with this season-by-season points total approach. "

    "For the purposes of creating a league ranking from the test set, the individual seasons in the test set can be separated in to smaller sets, and each row can be tagged with an identifier before being ran through the model, so that once predictions are made, they can be coupled back up with their uniqe indeitifier, and ordered, producing a league table to compare with the one that actually transpired in real life. The only problem with this approach is that even if every team in the given season does have a next season points tally, that tally might not be actually from the following season: there are always 3 teams who are relegated to the lower division at the end of each season, so it will be impossible to create a full league table based on next season points. to remedy this, the simple approach of identifying the teams that are promoted the following season from the lower division, and ranking them in 18th, 19th, and 20th place depending on whether they came in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd (play-off winners) in that prior season. This is a flaw in the methods employed, and future research would look to create more competent ways of creating a full league ranking, by quantifying the achievements of the newly-promoted teams in the lower division from which they came, and weighting them lighter in relation to the achievements of the teams in the higher division, in order to give a more elegant model which was capable of generating actual predicting power for the newly promoted teams that could see them ranked above higher division teams, as they often do end up in real life."

This last part is a not-particularly-empirical quantification of the ranking results, in which a classification accuracy is calculated, with a true positive being counted when a team is ranked in the correct position, and half a true positive is counted if a team is ranked just 1 place away from the correct position. the best percentage was 32.5%, while the average was 0.215. Also calculated were typical popular bets such as what team is crowned champions, what teams make it in to the top 4 and therefore get in to the european competitions, and what teams are relegated to the lower division.
