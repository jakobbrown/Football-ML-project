# Football-ML-project
using in-game football datasets, as well as scraping some financial data for different clubs to model the performance of a club the following season, thereby predicting success and league ranking when conducted on an entire league of teams

The in-game statistics were obtained in csv format, one per season per team. They were from the paid website footy-stats.org, and so - although I can't see any legal documentation on the website, I assume they have rights over the data files and so I won't make them available here. 

The financial data however I scraped from transfermrkt.com, with the help of a tutorial I will post below, along with other sources that either inspired the idea for this project or helped me greatly with their code online. 

This project was used as coursework for the 'principles of data science' module of my masters in data science, demonstrating a 'tiny project' that included all key stages of a typical data science project.
